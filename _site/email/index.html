<p><strong>DevOps: Bridging the Gap Between Development and Delivery</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></p>


    <p>
        This is a talk that focuses on leveraging modern toolsets to help achieve a smoother transition from development to delivery. I will present real-world problems facing current enterprise developers in a world where high-security requirements lead to even larger gaps between development and operations, and I will show how developers can utilize such tools as TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Runscope, Slack, and others to automate builds, deployments, testing, and analysis. Furthermore, I will demonstrate some real world solutions that Six Flags (a Tier-1 PCI Merchant) has implemented, and how these solutions have led to improved delivery reliability, increased security, decreased defect counts, and how they have essentially bridged the gap between development and delivery. I will cover the various technologies used which span .NET, Java, Objective-C, SQL Server, Click-Once, and others. This is a talk focused on helping developers take a pragmatic approach to DevOps in order to achieve a high level of success, reliability, and security when it comes to delivering the software they have crafted.
