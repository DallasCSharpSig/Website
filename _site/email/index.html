<p><strong>Visual Studio + Xamarin = Love</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></p>


    <p>
        So... Microsoft bought Xamarin, started giving away Xamarin for free, and open sourced the Xamarin stack. But what does that mean for *me*?
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I share lots of code between iOS, Android, Mac and UWP apps. Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I use Visual Studio with all of its cool tooling. Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I use C# and F#? Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I test these apps in the cloud on 1000's of devices. Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I still keep my sanity? Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        So come see all the cool new things in Xamarin and hear about how it and VS can make you love mobile development even more.

<p><strong><u>Adam Hill's Bio</u></strong></p>


    <p>
        Adam Hill is a local developer and loves the tech community here in DFW. He knew he wanted to be a programmer when he was 10 years old and never looked back. He loves hacking hardware and programming anything involving visualization, computer graphics, or games. Adam speaks at many user groups in DFW every year and puts on the local Global Game Jam at Collin College, a crazy, worldwide race to make a game in 72 hours. On the weekends you can find him gaming, making weird food and oh yeah... doing that code thing.
