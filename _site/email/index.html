<p><strong>Always Connected With Windows 10 Apps</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></p>


    <p>
        Demands and expectations of modern apps are much different than their predecessors. One thing that users expect is that their apps are 'always connected'. They expect things like notifications if something is new or changes and to share information between devices. This session will take a look at strategies to accomplish this in the world of Windows 10 apps. We will look at creating always connected apps that spans devices as well as platforms and you will leave with an understanding of what it takes to accomplish this in your own apps.
    </p>

    <p>
        - Review structures for sharing data between devices
    </p>

    <p>
        - How to use notifications to keep the user informed
    </p>

    <p>
        - Take advantage of the app life cycle to present an up to date UI
    </p>

    <p>
        - Using background tasks to keep your app connected
