<p><strong>Next Meeting Will Be November In Our New Location</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></p>


    <p>
        Our amazing sponsor Improving has some exciting news!  They have moved their offices to Frisco.
    </p>

    <p>
        This means the Dallas C# Sig is moving as well! The new office is a couple of blocks east of The Shops at Legacy.
    </p>

    <p>
        They need a little time to finish building out the user group spaces, so there will be no user groups the month of October.
    </p>

    <p>
        By then we'll have the website updated with the new address and information.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our next meeting will be in November. See you all then!
