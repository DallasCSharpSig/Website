<p><strong>Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi 2</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></p>

<p>Windows 10 has enabled the creation of the next generation of intelligent devices. In this talk you’ll learn about how to use Windows to build next generation devices based on hardware like the Raspberry Pi 2, as well as how to extend your devices with new  capabilities.  We will walk through the setting up the  development environment including both the desktop and the device.  We will demonstrate how to extend the platform to include support for popular Internet of Things (IoT) hardware interfaces. This is the beginning step for you to build rich devices based on the Raspberry Pi 2 from fun DIY arcade machines through enterprise level control systems.</p>
