<p><strong>Visual Studio + Xamarin = Love</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></p>


    <p>
        So... Microsoft bought Xamarin, started giving away Xamarin for free, and open sourced the Xamarin stack. But what does that mean for *me*?
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I share lots of code between iOS, Android, Mac and UWP apps. Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I use Visual Studio with all of its cool tooling. Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I use C# and F#? Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I test these apps in the cloud on 1000's of devices. Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can I still keep my sanity? Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        So come see all the cool new things in Xamarin and hear about how it and VS can make you love mobile development even more.
