        Functional programming has become a serious force in main stream development. A new breed of languages are growing in popularity in many ecosystems. F# for the CLR, Scala and Clojure on the JVM, Haskell, and even functional aspects of Javascript. Come see what all the buzz is about as we explore some of F#&#8217;s distinct features and strengths. We will start with new language constructs in F#, cover Type Providers, DSLs in F#, and demo canopy, a UI automation and testing framework written in F#.

        An introductory talk on the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architecture, featuring high level architecture discussion and a quick dip into a simple example project. This is not a comprehensive discussion of the topic, but a starter to help you determine if CQRS is right for you. We will discuss Service Bus, Event Sourcing, and Task Based UI concepts during this talk

        I have tried several different ways to build single-page web applications over the last 3 years.&nbsp; I started with iUI.&nbsp; The concept was cool but I quickly ran into road blocks.&nbsp; I tried jQTouch and got a little farther but again ran into road blocks.&nbsp; jQueryMobile had just come out and I though finally jQuery will get it right, but I spent all of my time fighting the framework. &nbsp;Then Knockout was released and it made things a lot better, but there were still issues like url routing.&nbsp; I started using a library called SammyJS and that solved the routing issue.&nbsp; My app was better, but I still wasn&#8217;t happy with my view models. &nbsp;They were way too big. It seemed like everything was happening in the view model.&nbsp; When I was finally able to get my app working I started having trouble managing all of the JavaScript dependencies and getting them loaded in the right order!&nbsp; It was all just a big pain! Then along came Durandal.<br/>Durandal has solved all these problems and many more that I didn&#8217;t even realize were going to be issues like JavaScript packaging and minification, and application messaging just to name a couple.&nbsp; Durandal accomplishes all of this and it is fun to use. In this talk we will dive into Durandal and the libraries that it sits on top of:&nbsp; jQuery, RequireJS, Knockout, and SammyJS.&nbsp; At the end of this session you will walk away with the tools you need to build an enterprise quality single-page web application.

        Are you looking to get better performance from your JavaScript? There is no need to sacrifice features and functionality! You can significantly cut a page&#8217;s load time simply by writing smarter code. In this session, we will explore the infamous DOM and discuss how JavaScript code is executed behind the curtain. Using real code examples, we will reveal how you can apply little known best practices and avoid the common pitfalls that curb performance.

        Unless you&#8217;ve been developing under a rock for the last year you&#8217;ve no doubt heard the deafening buzz in the development community around &#8220;the cloud.&#8221; But what is it? How can you take full advantage of it? Where do you begin? The cloud is more than a clever marketing buzzword. Much more. In this session, Casey begins by guiding the audience on a high-level tour of general cloud-related concepts then takes a deep dive into Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform through a series of interactive exercises. In this session you will learn the fundamental concepts of cloud computing including the range of execution models that Azure supports. You will also learn how to easily access Azure&#8217;s cloud services using the development platform and language of your choosing using Azure SDKs. The session will conclude with an audience-driven discussion covering special architectural considerations that should be taken when designing software for the cloud. By the end of the session you should know all that you need to hit the ground running creating massively scalable applications on the Azure platform. If you&#8217;re curious about the cloud and, more specifically, Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform, then you owe it to yourself to attend this session.

        So you have heard of this software craftsmanship movement, and you think it is a good idea. The question that stands is how do I do that? Is it enough to call myself a craftsman and start a blog? There is a lot more to being a software craftsman than the surface betrays. In this talk we will discuss some of the problems that plague the everyday coder, and the skills/practices that will help you transcend those problems. We will walk the gambit from what TDD and BDD are trying to do all the way to how UI design is not just for guys in turtle necks anymore. The evolution of computer users requires us to evolve as well and we will talk about and use some of the tools to guide that evolution.

        Web programming has always been a one-way conversation; a client calls a server and the server sends a response. But what if you could go the other direction? What if your server could call your client directly? No more inefficient polling. No more waiting for the next server poll to get your data; the server sends it as soon as it has it. Using a variety of techniques behind the scenes to smooth over the rough edges of dealing with variously capable browsers and web servers, SignalR makes real-time client-server communication ridiculously easy. Come see how this new library opens up a ton of possibilities for interactive and collaborative web applications
