        This is a talk that focuses on leveraging modern toolsets to help achieve a smoother transition from development to delivery. I will present real-world problems facing current enterprise developers in a world where high-security requirements lead to even larger gaps between development and operations, and I will show how developers can utilize such tools as TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Runscope, Slack, and others to automate builds, deployments, testing, and analysis. Furthermore, I will demonstrate some real world solutions that Six Flags (a Tier-1 PCI Merchant) has implemented, and how these solutions have led to improved delivery reliability, increased security, decreased defect counts, and how they have essentially bridged the gap between development and delivery. I will cover the various technologies used which span .NET, Java, Objective-C, SQL Server, Click-Once, and others. This is a talk focused on helping developers take a pragmatic approach to DevOps in order to achieve a high level of success, reliability, and security when it comes to delivering the software they have crafted.

        Thirteen years after the Agile Manifesto, how are we doing? Is it what the manifesto authors expected? Has our industry improved as a whole? Is agile just a passing fad that will fade away? We will take a brief journey back through the history of project management, technology, and organizational behavior. The evolutionary patterns of changes to each of these help us see how we got to where we are today, while providing useful forecasting insight. You might be surprised to learn the true origins of agile as we learn about emerging trends that give a glimpse into the future of product development.

        Reactive Extensions gets a bad reputation for being mind bendingly confusing. I'm going to show you a practical way to use this immense power that actually simplifies your code. We'll take a look at how the MVVM pattern in WPF (and Windows Phone/WinForms/Xamarin) is the perfect vehicle to utilize the full power of reactive programming.

        With all the talk about big data, Internet of things, and the value that can be derived from the analysis of all of that information, no one seems to talk about how we collect it.  There are a number of traditional ways.  Those ways usually have problems with how to handle data spikes, durability, and distribution for processing.  Azure Event Hubs may be an answer to part of those problems.  We will go over what they are, how to set them up, the costs, and the various ways to send and receive information.

        Demands and expectations of modern apps are much different than their predecessors. One thing that users expect is that their apps are 'always connected'. They expect things like notifications if something is new or changes and to share information between devices. This session will take a look at strategies to accomplish this in the world of Windows 10 apps. We will look at creating always connected apps that spans devices as well as platforms and you will leave with an understanding of what it takes to accomplish this in your own apps.

        You've seen them. Those really big view models that take on far too much responsibility. They send messages to other view models, they call services, and they run business logic. It's really hard to understand how these things work, and even harder to avoid breaking them when they need to change.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        See how the message bus pattern -- far from its original intent -- is actually coupling your view models. See why business logic always seems to end up in the wrong layer. And most importantly, learn a better alternative.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Writing clean view models is easy, but only if you have the tools to help you.

        I have programmed in JavaScript for several years and have repeatedly stubbed my toe on the this keyword.  In fact I have attempted several times to understand how the this keyword works in JavaScript, but have always just found pieces of the puzzle and never fully understood this in all circumstances.  Through hacking and debugging I have always been able to get my code to work the way I wanted, but this repeated failure or toe stubbing had left me feeling insecure.  In fact my lack of understanding and ability to control the this keyword was a cause of inward shame.  It was as if I was living a lie.  I was a JavaScript programmer who could not control the this keyword and I knew if I was ever to gain mastery over the language I was going to have to figure it out. Or spend the rest of my life in syntax inflicted fear and shame.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this talk we will dive deep into the this keyword in JavaScript.  We will understand how it behaves inside of functions, inside of methods, inside of constructors, and outside of functions.  We will learn there are a handful of rules to knowing the value of this at all times.  Finally, we will learn to take control of the this keyword, and bend it to our will.  Forcing it to be whatever we want it to be!

        Windows 10 has enabled the creation of the next generation of intelligent devices. In this talk you’ll learn about how to use Windows to build next generation devices based on hardware like the Raspberry Pi 2, as well as how to extend your devices with new  capabilities.  We will walk through the setting up the  development environment including both the desktop and the device.  We will demonstrate how to extend the platform to include support for popular Internet of Things (IoT) hardware interfaces. This is the beginning step for you to build rich devices based on the Raspberry Pi 2 from fun DIY arcade machines through enterprise level control systems.

Bitcoin has been gaining acceptance recently and is now used for over $50 million in transactions every day. A brief introduction to bitcoin, encryption and the concepts behind it will be included at the beginning of the talk. Multiple .NET applications and code samples will be shown to give attendees a head start in using this new technology for their own applications and/or games.

        Web development was a different game back in the early 2000s. Early versions of ASP.NET were aimed at Microsoft's existing customer base, and even tried to hide the nature of the web from developers who weren't ready for it. The platform has evolved steadily since the .NET Framework was released, but many of the technical decisions made early in ASP.NET’s life don't make sense in the context of modern web development. By cutting loose some of the baggage from earlier versions, the ASP.NET team has been able to make sweeping changes to bring the framework in line with its lightweight, agile contemporaries. In this presentation, Brian will show how the next version of ASP.NET will be leaner and more flexible than the platform has ever been. Topics covered will include the new command line tools, changes to Visual Studio, cross-platform usage, tag helpers, view components, and more.

        So you are curious about functional programming. You are wondering just what all the fuss is about. That’s perfect! This talk will assist your journey into functional programming. We will introduce some core concepts like higher order functions, composition, and currying. You will come to better understand the functional code that you’ve already encountered or written. We will also explore some of the functional approaches that have been shaping the C# language(as well as the .Net libraries) that you know and love.
