			<h2>Building Web Applications with Angular.js</h2>
			<h3>December 4, 2014</h2>
			<h3>Michael Dudley</h2>
			<p>It seems like everybody is talking about Angular these days.  They just released version 1.3 in October and version 2.0 is looming somewhere out there on the horizon.  In this talk we will set up an Angular.js application in ASP.net MVC using Visual Studio.  Then we will build out the functionality of a working flash card application.</p>

			<p>As we announced in October's meeting, we will not be meeting in November because Improving Enterprises is taking the entire company to Las Vegas for our company retreat. <br><br>If you want to go with us next year send me your resume at contact@dallas-csharp-sig.com and we'll get you set up with an interview! <br><br> See you in December...
