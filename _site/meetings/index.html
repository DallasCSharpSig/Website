        While ASP.NET is a powerful and versatile web framework, sometimes it&#8217;s just way more than you need to get the job done. Enter Nancy. Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony framework for building HTTP based services on .NET and Mono. And since it implements the OWIN standard, it can be hosted using Microsoft&#8217;s new Katana host, inside or outside of IIS. In this session, we&#8217;ll discuss how to get started with Nancy, from creating and bootstrapping a new application, to choosing from among the supported view engines, setting up authentication, to testing your modules end-to-end with Nancy&#8217;s Browser testing client.

        You&#8217;ve heard of the cloud. You&#8217;ve heard of Windows Azure. You have a general understanding of what it is but you still don&#8217;t fully understand how or why you would want to use it. If this sounds like you, you owe it to yourself to attend this session and get a foundational understanding of what exactly Windows Azure is and how you can leverage it in powerful ways in your new and existing .NET applications. In this session, Casey starts by covering some basic, high-level cloud-related topics to give you a solid foundation in cloud development, then moves on to how Windows Azure implements these ideas and makes them easily consumable to .NET developers. Finally, you will have the opportunity to dive in with Casey and build applications from scratch that leverage several important Azure features such as Azure storage and service bus. Bring your questions about Windows Azure to this highly interactive session. Note: Please be sure to sign up for a Windows Azure account at http://www.windowsazure.com before the session. If you want to follow along with the interactive sessions also be sure to bring a laptop with Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 and the Windows Azure SDK 2.2 installed. You can find the Windows Azure SDK 2.2 at http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/downloads/?sdk=net.

        I have tried several different ways to build single-page web applications over the last 3 years.&nbsp; I started with iUI.&nbsp; The concept was cool but I quickly ran into road blocks.&nbsp; I tried jQTouch and got a little farther but again ran into road blocks.&nbsp; jQueryMobile had just come out and I though finally jQuery will get it right, but I spent all of my time fighting the framework. &nbsp;Then Knockout was released and it made things a lot better, but there were still issues like url routing.&nbsp; I started using a library called SammyJS and that solved the routing issue.&nbsp; My app was better, but I still wasn&#8217;t happy with my view models. &nbsp;They were way too big. It seemed like everything was happening in the view model.&nbsp; When I was finally able to get my app working I started having trouble managing all of the JavaScript dependencies and getting them loaded in the right order!&nbsp; It was all just a big pain! Then along came Durandal.<br/>Durandal has solved all these problems and many more that I didn&#8217;t even realize were going to be issues like JavaScript packaging and minification, and application messaging just to name a couple.&nbsp; Durandal accomplishes all of this and it is fun to use. In this talk we will dive into Durandal and the libraries that it sits on top of:&nbsp; jQuery, RequireJS, Knockout, and SammyJS.&nbsp; At the end of this session you will walk away with the tools you need to build an enterprise quality single-page web application.

        Unless you&#8217;ve been developing under a rock for the last year you&#8217;ve no doubt heard the deafening buzz in the development community around &#8220;the cloud.&#8221; But what is it? How can you take full advantage of it? Where do you begin? The cloud is more than a clever marketing buzzword. Much more. In this session, Casey begins by guiding the audience on a high-level tour of general cloud-related concepts then takes a deep dive into Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform through a series of interactive exercises. In this session you will learn the fundamental concepts of cloud computing including the range of execution models that Azure supports. You will also learn how to easily access Azure&#8217;s cloud services using the development platform and language of your choosing using Azure SDKs. The session will conclude with an audience-driven discussion covering special architectural considerations that should be taken when designing software for the cloud. By the end of the session you should know all that you need to hit the ground running creating massively scalable applications on the Azure platform. If you&#8217;re curious about the cloud and, more specifically, Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform, then you owe it to yourself to attend this session.

        So you have heard of this software craftsmanship movement, and you think it is a good idea. The question that stands is how do I do that? Is it enough to call myself a craftsman and start a blog? There is a lot more to being a software craftsman than the surface betrays. In this talk we will discuss some of the problems that plague the everyday coder, and the skills/practices that will help you transcend those problems. We will walk the gambit from what TDD and BDD are trying to do all the way to how UI design is not just for guys in turtle necks anymore. The evolution of computer users requires us to evolve as well and we will talk about and use some of the tools to guide that evolution.

        Web programming has always been a one-way conversation; a client calls a server and the server sends a response. But what if you could go the other direction? What if your server could call your client directly? No more inefficient polling. No more waiting for the next server poll to get your data; the server sends it as soon as it has it. Using a variety of techniques behind the scenes to smooth over the rough edges of dealing with variously capable browsers and web servers, SignalR makes real-time client-server communication ridiculously easy. Come see how this new library opens up a ton of possibilities for interactive and collaborative web applications

        If you have ever worked with Entity Framework, even if you&#8217;re doing Entity Framework Code First, you are almost certainly doing it wrong. While Entity Framework is a wonderful framework, it doesn&#8217;t automatically force you into the correct patterns of use &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re interested in isolation and testability.<br /> This talk will review the concepts of both the Repository Pattern and the Specification Pattern and demonstrate how to implement them in Entity Framework.

        If you thought Silverlight was asynchronous, just a-wait till you see WinRT. Windows 8 is coming, and it has a completely new API. In addition to the familiar Win32, developers can now take advantage of WinRT to participate in the Metro experience.Just about every operation in WinRT is asynchronous. And not just web calls. Even opening a file is an async operation. Arm yourself with the latest tools in .NET 4.5 &#8212; the async and await keywords &#8212; to take full advantage of the platform.

If you&#8217;re a .NET developer and you&#8217;d like to take control of how you and your organization maintains, shares and uses application libraries, you owe it to yourself to take a look at NuGet, Microsoft&#8217;s answer to Ruby Gems. NuGet goes beyond simply adding references to your project and allows for fully automated configuration and setup of third-party libraries directly from within Visual Studio using either the GUI or Powershell. NuGet allows you to not only search through an ever-expanding catalog of application packages but also to discover new ones that can help you and your team be more productive. In this session, we&#8217;ll start by discussing package management from a high level, move on to installing, configuring and using NuGet form within the IDE and finally we&#8217;ll discuss how you can build your very own NuGet packages and distribute them either through the official NuGet stream or your own private repository.

        The .NET Micro Framework works best for devices that are low-cost, resource-constrained, single- or limited-function, and often connected. In this talk you will learn how to control hardware inputs and outputs using the .NET Micro framework and the FEZ Panda microcontroller. Possible inputs/outputs include sensors, RS-232, USB, microphones, other controllers, wireless transmissions, lights, motors, speakers and almost any electronic device you can think of. A brief introduction to electronics/circuits will be included at the beginning of the talk so no prior experience is necessary but being familiar with electronics and .NET programming will help.

        Scrum teams often discover that sticky note Scrum boards is a fun, functional, and low cost way to track and broadcast the state of a Scrum project.  There are some good reasons to store Scrum data electronically: to share/sync project state with multiple boards/locations, simplify reporting, change notifications, and enable historical data mining.  In this session we will look at the various options available to TFS users to manage their Scrum projects.  We will discuss the Visual Studio Scrum 1.0 process template, Urban Turtle scrum board, Telerik Team Pulse, and EMC TFS Workbench.

        So, you&#8217;re ready to ship that Windows application. &nbsp;Now what? &nbsp;How does the product get from the build machine onto the customer&#8217;s computer? &nbsp;Where does SETUP.EXE come from? &nbsp;What&#8217;s in those MSI files, anyway? &nbsp;Join us for a primer on deployment, one of the most overlooked, yet most arcane problems in software development. &nbsp;We will cover the core topics of Windows Installer, the standard deployment technology on Windows. &nbsp;Then we will explore WIX, Microsoft&#8217;s open-source toolset for authoring Windows Installer packages.

        Most developers face the tasks of managing and updating database schemas as part of their daily jobs.&nbsp; Even in organizations with a dedicated team of DBAs, the developers have to manage changes to table structures, views, and stored procedures to match the logic of their systems under development.&nbsp; While the Microsoft Visual Studio Team Edition for Database Professionals (aka DBPro) was originally built for DBAs to use to manage sophisticated database schemas, Microsoft has made it easy for developers to embrace the DBPro tools as an extension to the core Developer Edition tools.&nbsp; And with Visual Studio 2010 you don&#8217;t even have to install DBPro separately.&nbsp; In this talk, which is applicable to developers and DBAs alike, learn how to use the power Visual Studio database projects to get your schema definitions in source control, manage changes to databases across multiple environments, generate test data, write executable database test cases, and more.&nbsp; No matter which version of Visual Studio you use, you&#8217;ll find tools that will make your life with data much easier to manage.

        You are familiar with Test Driven Development (TDD), possibly already practicing it and getting its benefits. What if we told you that you can do even better? Join us at the Dallas C# SIG for an introduction to Behavior Driven Development (BDD). BDD helps a programmer produce an executable specification of their application&#8217;s behavior. This talk will introduce BDD concepts and demonstrate how to implement them in .Net using the MSpec framework.
