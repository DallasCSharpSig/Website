<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 8px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Michael has recorded Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, and Cryptography, in addition to Provable Code. He maintains the spoon-bending Update Controls and Correspondence open-source libraries. And he helps his clients at Improving Enterprises benefit from the power of software mathematics.
