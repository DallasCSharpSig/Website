abstract: [
"Thirteen years after the Agile Manifesto, how are we doing? Is it what the manifesto authors expected? Has our industry improved as a whole? Is agile just a passing fad that will fade away? We will take a brief journey back through the history of project management, technology, and organizational behavior. The evolutionary patterns of changes to each of these help us see how we got to where we are today, while providing useful forecasting insight. You might be surprised to learn the true origins of agile as we learn about emerging trends that give a glimpse into the future of product development."]
