title: "Happy Fourth of July"

abstract: [
"No meeting this month.  See you in August.",

"O beautiful for heroes proved In liberating strife, </br>
 Who more than self their country loved, </br>
 And mercy more than life! </br>
 America! America! May God thy gold refine </br>
 Till all success be nobleness, </br>
 And evâ€™ry gain divine!"
