Jeff is a Microsoft MVP, ASPInsider, ASP.Net developer evangelist at Telerik, an independent contributor to MSDN Magazine, and a Pluralsight Author. His first Pluralsight course, &#8216;Building a Facebook Application with ASP.Net&#8217; is being written now for publication in the late summer. At Telerik, he focuses on making ASP.Net developers more productive in building next generation applications with less code using all of the One ASP.Net platform. On the weekends this fall you can find him pining away over his misplaced college and pro football fandom.</p>
