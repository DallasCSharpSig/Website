<p><strong><strong>Abstract</strong></strong></p>
<p>In the last few years I&#8217;ve been working with different clients to build custom software using a BDD framework called Machine.Specifications (MSpec). I have learned a few tricks to help the clients get maximum value from their test suite. In this session, I&#8217;ll share what I&#8217;ve learned, things that have worked great and some that have not. I&#8217;ll also demonstrate tools and techniques that lead to expressive and maintainable tests.</p>
