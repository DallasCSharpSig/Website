<div id="_mcePaste">This C# code focused session will dive into how to use the API to do some wicked cool things. We&#8217;ll start by exploring the RGB and depth streams and then explore the skeletal tracking API. &nbsp;Next we&#8217;ll combine the different camera facets of the Kinect into a single demo. &nbsp;Next we&#8217;ll turn our focus to the Kinect&#8217;s audio features and take a look at Kinect&#8217;s high quality audio capabilities. &nbsp;To wrap up, we&#8217;ll combine all of these different features into one awesome demo.</div>
