abstract: Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred instantly and securely between any two people in the world. Bitcoin has been gaining acceptance recently and is now used for over $50 million in transactions every day. A brief introduction to bitcoin, encryption and the concepts behind it will be included at the beginning of the talk. Multiple .NET applications and code samples will be shown to give attendees a head start in using this new technology for their own applications and/or games.
