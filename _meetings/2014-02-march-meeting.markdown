abstract: While ASP.NET is a powerful and versatile web framework, sometimes it&#8217;s just way more than you need to get the job done. Enter Nancy. Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony framework for building HTTP based services on .NET and Mono. And since it implements the OWIN standard, it can be hosted using Microsoft&#8217;s new Katana host, inside or outside of IIS. In this session, we&#8217;ll discuss how to get started with Nancy, from creating and bootstrapping a new application, to choosing from among the supported view engines, setting up authentication, to testing your modules end-to-end with Nancy&#8217;s Browser testing client.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bio</span></strong></p>
<p>Brian Sullivan is a principal consultant for Improving Enterprises in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasn&#8217;t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.</p>
