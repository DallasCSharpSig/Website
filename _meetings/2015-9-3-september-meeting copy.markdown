abstract: ["Now that we have a released version of Visual Studio 2015, and .NET Framework 4.6, come spend some time learning about what the latest changes in the C# programming language enable you to do that you've never done before.  This will be a code-centric talk giving you concrete examples of how to use all of the language features, and how those can affect your choices for object design."]
