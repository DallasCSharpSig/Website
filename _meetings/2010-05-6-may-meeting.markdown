<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>You are familiar with Test Driven Development (TDD), possibly already practicing it and getting its benefits. What if we told you that you can do even better? Join us at the Dallas C# SIG for an introduction to Behavior Driven Development (BDD). BDD helps a programmer produce an executable specification of their application&#8217;s behavior. This talk will introduce BDD concepts and demonstrate how to implement them in .Net using the MSpec framework.</p>
