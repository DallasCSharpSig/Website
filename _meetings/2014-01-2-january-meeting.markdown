<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</span></strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard of the cloud. You&#8217;ve heard of Windows Azure. You have a general understanding of what it is but you still don&#8217;t fully understand how or why you would want to use it. If this sounds like you, you owe it to yourself to attend this session and get a foundational understanding of what exactly Windows Azure is and how you can leverage it in powerful ways in your new and existing .NET applications. In this session, Casey starts by covering some basic, high-level cloud-related topics to give you a solid foundation in cloud development, then moves on to how Windows Azure implements these ideas and makes them easily consumable to .NET developers. Finally, you will have the opportunity to dive in with Casey and build applications from scratch that leverage several important Azure features such as Azure storage and service bus. Bring your questions about Windows Azure to this highly interactive session. Note: Please be sure to sign up for a Windows Azure account at http://www.windowsazure.com before the session. If you want to follow along with the interactive sessions also be sure to bring a laptop with Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 and the Windows Azure SDK 2.2 installed. You can find the Windows Azure SDK 2.2 at http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/downloads/?sdk=net.</p>

<p>Casey Watson is a passionate software architect, President of the North Dallas Cloud Computing Group, dedicated husband and proud father. Casey believes that is the responsibility of every serious developer to constantly &#8220;sharpen their saw&#8221; through both reading and community involvement and is a strong advocate of SOLID development practices. Over the last eight years, he has been focused primarily on the .NET platform but has recently taken a keen interest in cloud development both on Amazon&#8217;s EC2 and Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform. Casey is heavily involved in the local development community having spoken at several user groups and conferences across the South Central region of the United States including Agile.NET, Dallas Days of .NET and TechX20. When not learning about, speaking on, writing about or building software, he can be found spending time with his family, updating his Twitter status (@_caseywatson), or enjoying an ice cold bottle of Blue Moon.</p>
