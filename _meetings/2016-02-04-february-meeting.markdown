abstract: [
"Reactive Extensions gets a bad reputation for being mind bendingly confusing. I'm going to show you a practical way to use this immense power that actually simplifies your code. We'll take a look at how the MVVM pattern in WPF (and Windows Phone/WinForms/Xamarin) is the perfect vehicle to utilize the full power of reactive programming."]
