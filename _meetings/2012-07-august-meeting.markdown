<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</span></strong><br />
If you have ever worked with Entity Framework, even if you&#8217;re doing Entity Framework Code First, you are almost certainly doing it wrong. While Entity Framework is a wonderful framework, it doesn&#8217;t automatically force you into the correct patterns of use &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re interested in isolation and testability.<br />
This talk will review the concepts of both the Repository Pattern and the Specification Pattern and demonstrate how to implement them in Entity Framework.</p>
