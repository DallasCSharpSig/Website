<p>While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not. Unfortunately, binding these two platforms together can result in significant amounts of lost productivity and a less than optimal solution. Come see how you can resolve this recurring theme with the newest release of the Microsoft <a href="http://ado.net/">ADO.NET</a> Entity Framework. &nbsp;In this session, we&#8217;ll</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the Entity Framework 4.1, its components and see how it all works</li>
<li>Define an object model and implement persistence from POCO classes, including customizing persistence mapping via the fluent API</li>
<li>Walk through a variety of code examples that show how to interact with the model</li>
<li>Show how the Entity Framework automatically tracks data changes and generates updates</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;ll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the new &#8220;code only&#8221; extensions allows the developer to implement a much more code-centric approach to store persistence</p>
