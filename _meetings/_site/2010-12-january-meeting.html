<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The .NET Micro Framework works best for devices that are low-cost, resource-constrained, single- or limited-function, and often connected. In this talk you will learn how to control hardware inputs and outputs using the .NET Micro framework and the FEZ Panda microcontroller. Possible inputs/outputs include sensors, RS-232, USB, microphones, other controllers, wireless transmissions, lights, motors, speakers and almost any electronic device you can think of. A brief introduction to electronics/circuits will be included at the beginning of the talk so no prior experience is necessary but being familiar with electronics and .NET programming will help.</p>
