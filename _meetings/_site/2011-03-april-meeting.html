<div id="_mcePaste">Abstract:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Amir will show you how you can leverage Behavior Driven Development concepts to drive development of an ASP.NET MVC application. &nbsp;Continuous testing, test driven development, and &#8220;red, green, re-factor&#8221; are all important techniques with practical applications. &nbsp;We&#8217;ll start with a crash course on BDD, and then see how we can bend NUnit to our whim to develop an MVC application using a behavior driven approach.</div>
