<p><strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</span></strong></strong></p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been developing under a rock for the last year you&#8217;ve no doubt heard the deafening buzz in the development community around &#8220;the cloud.&#8221; But what is it? How can you take full advantage of it? Where do you begin? The cloud is more than a clever marketing buzzword. Much more. In this session, Casey begins by guiding the audience on a high-level tour of general cloud-related concepts then takes a deep dive into Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform through a series of interactive exercises. In this session you will learn the fundamental concepts of cloud computing including the range of execution models that Azure supports. You will also learn how to easily access Azure&#8217;s cloud services using the development platform and language of your choosing using Azure SDKs. The session will conclude with an audience-driven discussion covering special architectural considerations that should be taken when designing software for the cloud. By the end of the session you should know all that you need to hit the ground running creating massively scalable applications on the Azure platform. If you&#8217;re curious about the cloud and, more specifically, Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform, then you owe it to yourself to attend this session.</p>

<p>Casey Watson is CTO at Excolo Group, a passionate software architect, dedicated husband and proud father. Casey believes that is the responsibility of every serious developer to constantly &#8220;sharpen their saw&#8221; through both reading and community involvement and is a strong advocate of SOLID development practices. Over the last eight years, he has been focused primarily on the .NET platform but has recently taken a keen interest in cloud development both on Amazon&#8217;s EC2 and Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform. Casey is heavily involved in the local development community having spoken at several user groups and conferences across the South Central region of the United States including Agile.NET, Dallas Days of .NET and TechX20. When not learning about, speaking on, writing about or building software, he can be found spending time with his family, updating his Twitter status (@_caseywatson), or enjoying an ice cold bottle of Blue Moon.</p>
