abstract: 250 Billion. &nbsp;That&#8217;s roughly the average minimum number of HTTP requests sent through the internet each day. &nbsp;We&#8217;re going to completely dissect every tiny event that happens when you navigate to a web site. &nbsp;Do you really understand exactly what&#8217;s going on under the hood with the browser, the internet, the server, IIS, and ASP.net routing? &nbsp;You most definitely will after this session. &nbsp;We&#8217;re going to talk about HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP, the OSI model, IIS, ASP.net, browsers, Fiddler, WireShark, Microsoft Network Monitor, and of course&#8230; bacon. &nbsp;If you&#8217;re a real geek like me and like to know what the heck&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, you&#8217;ll enjoy this talk!

<p><strong><strong>Bio</strong></strong></p>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<p class="p1">Wil has been writing software in one form or another since 1982. &nbsp;Yes, he&#8217;s a freakin&#8217; dinosaur but hey, dinosaurs are cool. &nbsp;Wil lives in Frisco with his wife and four kiddos and currently works for Perficient. &nbsp;He has been obsessed with software quality and performance since high school and retains the passion today. &nbsp;He&#8217;s written device drivers for OS/2 in C and Assembler, insurance software in Turbo Pascal, medical software in C++ and various other tidbits with C# since 2000. Today, mostly he gets to work with some great people on fun problems that involve C#, JavaScript, ASP.net, Entity Framework, the &#8220;Cloud&#8221;, and great patterns like SOLID. &nbsp;Wil loves teaching as much as learning and if software were no longer part of his life, he would travel, photograph the world, and enjoy all the sun and water to be found with his fun, athletic, and gorgeous wife Julie.</p>
