abstract: So, you&#8217;re ready to ship that Windows application. &nbsp;Now what? &nbsp;How does the product get from the build machine onto the customer&#8217;s computer? &nbsp;Where does SETUP.EXE come from? &nbsp;What&#8217;s in those MSI files, anyway? &nbsp;Join us for a primer on deployment, one of the most overlooked, yet most arcane problems in software development. &nbsp;We will cover the core topics of Windows Installer, the standard deployment technology on Windows. &nbsp;Then we will explore WIX, Microsoft&#8217;s open-source toolset for authoring Windows Installer packages.
