<p>As we announced in October&#8217;s meeting, we will not be meeting in November because Improving Enterprises is taking the entire company to Las Vegas for our company retreat.</p>
<p>If you want to go with us next year send me your resume at:</p>
<p>contact@dallas-csharp-sig.com</p>
<p>and we&#8217;ll get you set up with an interview!</p>
<p>See you in December&#8230; Michael Dudley</p>
