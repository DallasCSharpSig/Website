<div id="_mcePaste">A lot of IT people are talking about &#8220;Agile&#8221; these days. &nbsp;But do they really know what it means to be agile? &nbsp;And more importantly, do you know what it could mean for your job, your career, your company? &nbsp;As software developers, agile practices are having a great impact on how we build software and promise to greatly improve the quality of our work.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">This talk begins with the agile mindset, demonstrates pragmatic agile software development practices, and explores the impact that agile methods can have on any software project. &nbsp;If you&#8217;ve never heard of &#8220;agile&#8221; before, you&#8217;ll learn from the ground up. &nbsp;If you&#8217;ve always wondered what it really means, you&#8217;ll come away with a crystalized understanding. &nbsp;And if you&#8217;re familiar with the concepts, you&#8217;ll see techniques in action, from customer conversation to product delivery, and understand with renewed clarity where our industry is headed with process improvement.</div>
