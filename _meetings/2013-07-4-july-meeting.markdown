<p><strong><strong>Abstract</strong></strong></p>
<p>I have tried several different ways to build single-page web applications over the last 3 years.&nbsp; I started with iUI.&nbsp; The concept was cool but I quickly ran into road blocks.&nbsp; I tried jQTouch and got a little farther but again ran into road blocks.&nbsp; jQueryMobile had just come out and I though finally jQuery will get it right, but I spent all of my time fighting the framework. &nbsp;Then Knockout was released and it made things a lot better, but there were still issues like url routing.&nbsp; I started using a library called SammyJS and that solved the routing issue.&nbsp; My app was better, but I still wasn&#8217;t happy with my view models. &nbsp;They were way too big. It seemed like everything was happening in the view model.&nbsp; When I was finally able to get my app working I started having trouble managing all of the JavaScript dependencies and getting them loaded in the right order!&nbsp; It was all just a big pain! Then along came Durandal.</p>
<p>Durandal has solved all these problems and many more that I didn&#8217;t even realize were going to be issues like JavaScript packaging and minification, and application messaging just to name a couple.&nbsp; Durandal accomplishes all of this and it is fun to use. In this talk we will dive into Durandal and the libraries that it sits on top of:&nbsp; jQuery, RequireJS, Knockout, and SammyJS.&nbsp; At the end of this session you will walk away with the tools you need to build an enterprise quality single-page web application.</p>
